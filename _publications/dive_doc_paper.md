excerpt: 'This paper is about optimizing Visual Encoder (VE) of end-to-end DocVQA architectures. By reducing by 5x the size of the VE from a foundational to a hierarchical architecture, DIVE-Doc achieves a performance gap of 2.10 (ANLS) compared to its teacher Paligemma through a distillation training process. Evaluation of the VE on downstream tasks (document classification & layout analysis) led to the conclusion that the VE seems to capture global structure of documents while semantic layout understanding seems to be achieved inside the language model decoder.'
